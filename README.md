## Overview
Energy Demand Forecast is a comprehensive machine learning solution designed to predict energy consumption patterns across short-term (hourly/daily), medium-term (weekly/monthly), and long-term (yearly) horizons. The system ingests historical energy usage data alongside external factors to generate accurate and reliable energy demand forecasts.

## Features
- **Multi-horizon forecasting**: Generate predictions for different time frames (24h ahead, 7 days ahead, monthly)
- **Anomaly detection**: Identify and flag unusual consumption patterns in real-time
- **Seasonal pattern analysis**: Decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components
- **Feature importance analysis**: Determine key drivers of energy demand through statistical methods
- **Model comparison framework**: Evaluate and compare multiple forecasting techniques
- **Interactive visualization dashboard**: Explore forecasts through intuitive plots and charts
- **Configurable preprocessing pipeline**: Customize data cleaning and feature engineering steps
- **Export capabilities**: Generate reports and export predictions in multiple formats

## Technologies
- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **Data processing**: pandas, numpy, dask for large datasets
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn,
- **Statistical analysis**: statsmodels, scipy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Version control**: Git
- **Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests

## Data
The project uses the following data sources:
- Historical energy consumption data at various time granularities

Data preprocessing includes:
- Missing value imputation
- Outlier detection and handling
- Feature normalization
- Time series decomposition

## Models
Several forecasting models are implemented and compared:
- Statistical methods: ARIMA, TBATS, Exponential Smoothing
- Machine Learning: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Model evaluation metrics include:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

## Visualization
Interactive dashboards and plots are provided to explore forecasts, analyze trends, and compare model performance. These visualizations are built using libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.

## Results
Include key findings, model performance comparisons, and important insights discovered during the project. Visualizations and performance metrics can be added here.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional external factors such as energy prices and geopolitical events
- Enhance model interpretability using SHAP values and other explainability techniques
- Develop real-time prediction capabilities for streaming data
- Expand support for distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark
